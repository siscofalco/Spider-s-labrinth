# Spider's Labyrinth ðŸ•· 

This project is a 80's inspired arcade game where your character has to walk through a labyrinth in order to get a special trophy, while surviving the deadly spiders.

The original idea consists of three different levels, same map but more difficulty regarding the enemies (spiders).

<li>Welcome screen</li>
<li>Labyrinth: map where the game takes place, main character has to be controlled and moved by the user.</li>
